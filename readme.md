# About
This program was created out of a need to see what changes could happen if I ran a robocopy command between 2 directories. I was hoping at first that robocopy (command line application built into windows) had this functionality built in.
While there a number of different ways to compare files, I chose to use the LastModifided timestamp of the file for distinction.

# Learnings
* Parallel tasks
* File enumeration
